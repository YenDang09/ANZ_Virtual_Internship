### ***Taks1 : Exploratory Data Analysis***
This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. 
It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Gather some interesting overall insights about the data: average transaction amount, average monthly transaction, ...
- Segment the dataset by transaction date and time: visualise transaction volume and spending over the course of an average day or week, 
Consider the effect of any outliers that may distort your analysis.

### ***Task 2: Predictive Analytics***
Explore correlations between customer attributes, build a regression and a decision-tree prediction model based on your findings.
Using the same transaction dataset, identify the annual salary for each customer
- Explore correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes (e.g. age)
- Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes defined
- How accurate is your model?
